## Express rendering for React with dynamic metatags


In the project directory, you can run to start development server:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

 <br />

To actually test the dynamic tags, make a build and serve (edit serve.js to your liking)

### `npm run build`

### `node serve.js`

`(or use nodemon, pm2 etc)`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Visit a page after `node serve.js` (eg [http://localhost:3000/blog/1](http://localhost:3000/blog/1)), and reload to see dynamically added tags by express with View
